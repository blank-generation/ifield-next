# Marriot Surat

The Marriott Hotel in Surat was built on the bones of the Taj hotel. iField handled this transformation, handling 209 keys. 3D printing effects were used to make headboards, and glass sliding doors with a mirror on one side made each room feel spacious and unique. This project took place while the hotel was already operational, and was implemented in seamless phases, ensuring that the hotel guests were undisturbed.
