# Introduction

Parsing and display of math equations is included in this blog template. Parsing of math is enabled by `remark-math` and `rehype-katex`.
KaTeX and its associated font is included in `_document.js` so feel free to use it on any page.
^[For the full list of supported TeX functions, check out the [KaTeX documentation](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html)]

Inline math symbols can be included by enclosing the term between the `$` symbol.

Math code blocks are denoted by `$$`.

If you intend to use the `$` sign instead of math, you can escape it (`\$`), or specify the HTML entity (`&dollar;`) [^2]

Inline or manually enumerated footnotes are also supported. Click on the links above to see them in action.

[^2]: \$10 and &dollar;20.
